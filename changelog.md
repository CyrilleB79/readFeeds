## Changes
* Feeds are managed from OPML files.
* Due to changes in the feeds management system, there are changes in the configuration file where the default feed is set. Please, use the Feeds dialog if you want to set it again.
* Your old text files used in previous versions will be automatically imported into the new OPML format when the add-on is started.
* Non well-formed feeds can be processed before being added to make them compatible with the add-on.
